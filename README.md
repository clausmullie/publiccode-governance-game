This is a game on governance of [Public Code](https://about.publiccode.net/glossary/public-code-definition.html).
Use this as a way to get a conversation and reflection about governance started.
We aim to use it during [early incubation of a codebase](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/product-assets-for-early-incubation.html), or perhaps even earlier.
You can of course play the game totally without our involvement, it is probably useful for any constellation that have a codebase to govern.

## Playing the game

You need a few people to play with you.
There is no strict number, but you all need to be able to see and reach the cards on the table.
For the actual rules, see the rules cards.

If you want to use the game in a workshop or online, see [our workshop guide](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/supporting-codebase-governance/game/run-governance-game-workshop.html).

We also want to thank everyone who has played the game with us.

## Building cards

The Makefile automatically generates a complete card deck for the Governance Game in PDF and PNG.

### Dependencies

```
sudo apt install docbook-utils pandoc inkscape texlive texlive-fonts-extra \
	texlive-extra-utils qpdf aspell aspell-en
# sudo apt install texlive-full
```

The `Inter` font family is used.
The `texlive-fonts-extra` package provides `latex/inter/inter.sty`.
To generate `.png` files, `inkscape` requires these fonts to be installed.
Download the [Inter font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).
Ensure that the fonts are installed in your system, for example
[Debian Installation of True Type Fonts](https://wiki.debian.org/TrueType#Installation_of_True_Type_Fonts).
Or `make ensure-font` to run [`script/ensure-font.sh`](script/ensure-font.sh).

### Usage

Type `make` to generate the PDF files.

Type `make view-all` to view all of the PDF files generated.

## Website

The website is built from the `gh-pages` branch.
