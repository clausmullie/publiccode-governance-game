    longDescription: |
      This is a game on governance of [Public
      Code](https://about.publiccode.net/glossary/public-code-definition.html).
      Use this as a way to get a conversation and reflection about governance
      started. We aim to use it during [early incubation of a
      codebase](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/product-assets-for-early-incubation.html),
      or perhaps even earlier. You can of course play the game totally without
      our involvement, it is probably useful for any constellation that have a
      codebase to govern.


      ## **Playing the game**


      You need a few people to play with you. There is no strict number, but you
      all need to be able to see and reach the cards on the table. For the
      actual rules, see the rules cards.
